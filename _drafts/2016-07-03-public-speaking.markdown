When I was a child, I was terrified of public speaking and having to stand in front of people.
I was terrified to be the center of attention in front of a group of people, even when that group
was my own friends. As a child, I saw that all adults didn't have a problem when it came
to public speaking, so I thought it was, like a pair of velcro light up Power Rangers shoes, something you grow out of.
Now that I'm an adult, I can see that I was wrong.

Stop me if you've heard this one. Your co-worker, Sally, has to give a demo of her work in a meeting at work.
Sally is a very intelligent, educated and competent woman, but she is terrified of talking in front of people.
Sally knows this so she does the only thing she can; she prepares for days on end. She makes slides, cue cards,
and even creates a song that helps her memorize the demo. <em>Ding Dong!</em> Who's at the door? It's demo day!
The demo goes horribly. Sally is visibly shaking, talking to the projector screen, saying "uhm" more than actual
words in her sentences, and fumbling over her cue cards. Fifteen grueling minutes later, the demo is over. To Sally's
bosses, she appeared unprepared and unskilled, which is completely untrue.
</p>

<p>
Unfortunately for Sally, no amount of preparation was going to help her deliver this demo any better.
Another unfortunate fact is that Sally will not be able to change this behavior very easily. She will
 have to work at it for months, maybe years. Some people never change this behavior and it ends
 up costing them financially and professionally. The unfortunate truth is that someone that
 can talk in front of a crowd charismatically will be favored over the current holder of the
 "Most 'uhm's In A Sentence" title.
