<p>Traditionally, when a developer is learning a new language, the first application they
 create is the 'Hello World!' application. Well, here's mine. I'm coming to a couple of firsts here.
  I've never used <a href="https://jekyllrb.com/" target="_blank">Jekyll</a> to create a blog, made a personal website, bought a domain, written a blog post,
   used <a href="https://pages.github.com/" target="_blank">GitHub Pages</a> to host a website, and other things I can't remember right now.
</p>

<p>The reason I've never bothered with blogging or a personal website is because I never felt
like my words were important enough to be on a website of my own. I'm not implying
that my words are of any important now. I just felt like doing this little project for myself.</p>

<h3>What can I expect from this blog?</h3>
Not much, probably. If anything, a laugh at my expense or at something I wrote.

<h3>What topics will you try cover here?</h3>
<p>The things I'm interested in vary, but I'm hoping to cover some developer related topics here.
Although, I will not limit myself to that. I have many other joys, such as working on my car,
playing music, building Gundam models, playing Dungeons & Dragons, listening to fantasy books,
reading manga, watching anime, and much more!</p>
