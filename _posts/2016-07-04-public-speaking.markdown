When I was a child, I was terrified of public speaking and having to stand in front of people, even when that group
was my own friends. As a child, I saw that all adults didn't have a problem when it came
to public speaking, so I thought it was, like a pair of velcro light up Power Rangers shoes, something you grow out of.
Now that I'm an adult, I can see that I was wrong.

Stop me if you've heard this one. Your co-worker, Sally, has to give a demo of her work in a meeting at work.
Sally is a very intelligent, educated, and competent woman, but she is terrified of talking in front of people.
Sally knows this so she does the only thing she can; she prepares. She makes slides, cue cards,
and even creates a jingle to help her memorize the demo.
</p>

<p><em>Ding Dong!</em> Who's at the door? It's demo day!
The demo goes horribly. Sally is visibly shaking, talking to the projector screen, saying "uhm" more than actual
words in her sentences, and fumbling over her cue cards. Fifteen grueling minutes later, the demo is over. To Sally's
bosses, she appeared unprepared and unskilled, which we know to be untrue.
</p>

Unfortunately for Sally, no amount of preparation in such a short amount of time was going to help her deliver this demo any better.
Another unfortunate fact is that Sally will not be able to change this behavior very easily. She will
 have to work at it for months, maybe years. Some people never change this behavior and it ends
 up costing them financially and professionally. The sad truth is that someone that
 can talk in front of a crowd charismatically will be favored, professionally, over the current holder of the
 "Most 'uhm's In A Sentence" title.

So, now you're probably sitting there thinking one of two things, "Cool story, broseph ballin, but that ain't me." or
"That is totally me! How can I get over my fear of public speaking?" If this was an infomercial, I would now
say something like, "If you call now, you can get my 16 part cassette tape series for only $4.99/month for the next 32 months!"
</p>

Jokes aside, I can't tell you what will work for you, but I can tell you what worked for me. My favorite and, I think,
most effective strategy is to just jump in to a situation without thinking. Throughout school, I had to give plenty of
speeches and presentations. I was like our friend Sally. I stuttered, I trembled, and I talked to the projector
screen, but each presentation I gave, helped me improve a small bit. Eventually, I became a moderately competent
speaker. Another huge component was realizing that I should not care as much. I was nervous because I felt my
peers judging me, but in reality, they are indifferent and are just waiting for you to finish so they can go back
to playing Candy Crush.

<p>
There are plenty of other resources you can use to improve your public speaking skills, such as: taking a class,
reading a self help book, or talking to someone that is more outgoing than you. Gaining proficiency in public speaking will
improve your life greatly. You will no longer dread talking in front of people and will
enjoy contributing to conversations or meetings at work. Just remember these sage words that helped me realize my potential: "You gotta fake it 'til you make it."
