Pok&#233;mon Go has taken the nation, no, the world by storm! Friends and family you
never though would touch Pok&#233;mon are now playing! This phenomenon has exceeded
all of my expectations. I'm not here to talk about game mechanics or strategies,
though. I'm here to talk about the social aspect of the game. No matter where
you live, you have seen them; the to-be Pok&#233;mon Masters. They wander our once
desolate streets in search of Pok&#233;Stops and Pok&#233;mon. If you search around, you'll
find plenty of articles talking about how this event is a plague on humanity or
how dangerous catching Pok&#233;mon has become, but these sources thrive on shinning
a negative light on events such as these. I'm here to talk about the benefits of
Pok&#233;mon Go!

Just today, I took a walk around my town, which I've lived in for over twenty
years, and I was amazed at what my little town had to offer. Every town has something
amazing to offer, if you take the time to look, but when you are a resident of that town, you often dismiss
certain activities or attractions as a "tourist" activities. Unfortunately, living in
sunny San Diego, I dismiss most things as a "tourist" activities. Regardless, today I
went on what I call "Pok&#233;Walkies" in an effort to become one of many Pok&#233;mon
Masters. I knew that the Pok&#233;Stops and Pok&#233;mon spawn more frequently in populated
areas, so I set course for my town's most populated area; which happens to be our
Downtown area. I could have driven, but I chose to get the extra items from the
landmarks, or Pok&#233;Stops, near my house. For those who don't know, Pok&#233;Stops are popular areas
that will grant the player free items. Most people know this, but what is often
overlooked is that these Pok&#233;Stops hold some pretty interesting sights.

On my walk to the Downtown area, I found myself discovering completely new sights and
landmarks. Everything ranging from masterfully decorated electric boxes to detailed murals on the side
of local businesses. This was quite a shock to me. How could I, who has lived in this
town for most of my life, miss such amazing sights?! I was ashamed of myself, but
excited for the sights of Downtown yet to come. On my way to Downtown, I ended up
getting quite hungry, for it was after work and I hadn't eaten yet. I wasn't
interested in the popular fast food chains, so I pressed on, heading towards a
Pok&#233;Stop. To my surprise, the Pok&#233;Stop I was heading towards led me to a Greek
restaurant I hadn't been to before. I quickly, and hungrily, decided this was
fate guiding me, and ended up having a wonderful, nutritious meal there. Filled with
some delicious Mediterranean cuisine, I continued on my journey.

Shortly after my meal, I reached the Downtown area. I was astonished to find that
there were tons of people varying in age, race, and gender. Even more surprising
was that they were all socializing! I ended up walking around for five miles and
two hours! I found some people that were from my same faction, go Team Mystic, and
we walked around conquering Gyms together. With each Pok&#233;Stop I went to, I would
discover something new and amazing. Eventually the sun started setting and I decided
to head home before the streets began to darken further.

As I sit here writing this post, I am extremely happy with my experience today.
Not only did I gain many items and Pok&#233;mon in the game, but I gained a new understanding
and appreciation for the town I call Home. I don't know how long this phenomenon
 will last, but I am happy that moments like this are happening. If you haven't
been swallowed in by the Pok&#233;mon Go excitement, I would recommend it just for the fact
that you can re-discover new, interesting sights in your once familiar town.
