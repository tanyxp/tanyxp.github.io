Pok&#233;mon Go has taken the nation, no, the world by storm! Friends and family you
never thought would touch Pok&#233;mon are now playing! This phenomenon has exceeded
all of my expectations. I'm not here to talk about game mechanics or strategies. 
I'm here to talk about the social aspects of the game. No matter where
you live, you have seen them; the to-be Pok&#233;mon Masters. They wander our once
desolate streets in search of Pok&#233;Stops and Pok&#233;mon. If you search around, you'll
find plenty of articles talking about how this game is a plague on humanity or
how dangerous catching Pok&#233;mon is becoming, but these sources thrive on shinning
a negative light on events such as these. I'm here to talk about the benefits of
Pok&#233;mon Go!

Just today, I took a walk around my town, which I've lived in for over twenty
years, and I was amazed at what my little town had to offer. Every town has something
amazing to offer, if you take the time to look. Today I went on what I call "Pok&#233;Walkies"
in an effort to become one of many Pok&#233;mon Masters. I knew that the Pok&#233;Stops and
Pok&#233;mon spawn more frequently in populated
areas, so I set course for Downtown. I could have driven the short mile and saved myself some time, 
but I chose to get the extra items from the
landmarks, or Pok&#233;Stops, near my house. For those who don't know, Pok&#233;Stops are popular areas
that will grant the player free items. Most players know this, but what is often
overlooked is that these Pok&#233;Stops are home to some awesome sights.

On my walk to the Downtown area, I found myself discovering completely new sights and
landmarks. Everything ranging from masterfully decorated electric boxes to detailed murals on the side
of local businesses. This was quite a shock to me. How could I, who has lived in this
town for most of my life, miss such beautiful sights?! I was ashamed of myself, but
excited for the sights of Downtown yet to come. During my enjoyable journey, my stomach began to rumble angrily, for it was after work and I hadn't eaten dinner. I wasn't
interested in the popular fast food chains that littered the streets, so I pressed on towards a nearby
Pok&#233;Stop. To my surprise, the Pok&#233;Stop I was heading towards was beside a Greek
restaurant I hadn't been to before. I quickly, and hungrily, decided this was
fate guiding me, and ended up having a wonderful, and nutritious, Greek salad with gyros. Filled with
some delicious Mediterranean cuisine, I continued on my journey.

Shortly after my meal, I reached the Downtown area. I was astonished to find that
there were so many people varying in age, race, and gender. Even more surprising
was that they were all socializing! I ended up walking around for five miles and
two hours! I found some players that were from my same faction, go Team Mystic, and
we walked around conquering Gyms together. With each Pok&#233;Stop I went to, I would
discover a new statue, community garden, or museum. I was having a blast touring my town!
Eventually the sun began to drift below the horizon and I decided to head home before the streets began to darken any further.

As I sit here writing this post, I am extremely happy with my experience today.
Not only did I gain many items and Pok&#233;mon in the game, but I got my daily steps in and gained a new found appreciation for the town I call Home. I don't know how long this phenomenon
 will last, but I am happy that players all over are experiencing moments like this. If you haven't
been introduced to the Pok&#233;mon Go excitement, I would recommend it just for the fact
that you can re-discover new and interesting sights in your once familiar town.
